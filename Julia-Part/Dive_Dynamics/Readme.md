# A more detailed study of dyanmics via Julia simulations

Not large scale, but do things in more detail.

## Jun 23
The plan is to focus on $N_S = N_R$ slid, and distinguish chaos, limit cycle, alternative stable states, and (glassy) transitions. Also make dispersal as a variable and test how large it will change the results.

## Jun 25
Criterion in classifying communites changed. Pay attention to distinguish old and new data.

## Jul 8
Wide range of initial conditions, changed to old classifier, stict stability criterion.

## Jul 9
Jul 8 night, num_init changed to 100 for const supply. Check in the morning. Fig. 4!!!

## Jul 15
Try to study relation between $\mathrm{det} (GC^T)$ and global stability.

## Aug 28
GRSRv1 samples 1440 rho. For better figure 4.
